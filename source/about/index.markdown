# Why ?

Searching the Internet for tutorials on how to teach Computer Programming to children aged between 7 and 14 years (in a language other than English) and willing to show to their own children that it is possible to do something more creative with computers than just watching YouTube videos or reading comments on Facebook, some members of the DEVOXX team started in 2012 the Devoxx4Kids initiative.

# Goal

The goal of Devoxx4Kids is to allow children to be more creative with computers and teach them Computer Programming while having fun.

# How ?

To accomplish this, the Devoxx4Kids team organizes sessions where children can develop computer games, program robots and also have an introduction to electronics. 
Teachers are computer professionals that are volunteering to spend some of their free time to transmit their passion to children.
