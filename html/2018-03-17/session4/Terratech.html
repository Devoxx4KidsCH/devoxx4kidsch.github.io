  <p> TerraTech is an open world sandbox survival game from Payload Studios. Set amongst the stars, this is the story of an Earth contending with an expanding population and environmental damage, with profit-driven multinational
  corporations leading the charge to seek out and colonise new planets.
Your job is to lead that assault, building contraptions and vehicles out an array of different parts – some scavenged from others – as you look to harvest resources from your new endless, alien home to send back to Earth.
This means, as well as tracking down the planet’s assets ahead of your rivals, you will also find yourself taking them on in direct combat, clearing the way for your fleet to dominate the off world.
And with said battles come the spoils of war. New vehicle parts and weapons can be scavenged from other prospectors or built from the minerals and resources you find, and by testing new technologies or discovering new blueprints
 you can further boost your fleet's capabilities. </p>

  <a href="https://terratech.gamepedia.com/Corporations">here are the Corporations</a>
  
 
  
  <p> <img style="width:500px;" src="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/terratech_gamepedia/f/f3/GalacticSurveyOrganisation%28GSO%29.png?version=387250e475d3bf75514f85388a76d899" /> </p>
  
  <h3>GSO</H3>
  
  </p>GSO is the basic corporation in TerraTech. As a jack of all trades, it does not specialize in any particular field.
  GSO is ideal for an early-game tech, a highly mobile and small tech, (though Venture is more ideal) and an inexpensive tech to go "hunting" in.
  GSO's parts are old and outdated, but still functional.
  The player starts out with this license and as the player progresses, they will pick up other licenses.
  GSO has 91 blocks. out of those 91, 8 are obsolete and have been or will be removed. 83 are still in the game. 
   
  <p> <img style="width:500px;" src="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/terratech_gamepedia/thumb/2/25/GeoCorp.png/200px-GeoCorp.png?version=b5baf772c450b620a6df6a37359f9f4d" /> </p>
  
  <h3>GEOCORP</h3>
  
  GeoCorp is the heavy mining and recourse collecting corporation in TerraTech. It has many large blocks, wheels, drills, and collectors.
  Everything about GeoCorp is heavy duty. The blocks are sturdy and will take a long time to break, the armor plating is just plain beefy, and the cabs take ages to destroy.
  in the arsenal there are no ranged weapons-just plasma cutters, massive drills, hydraulic hammers, and diamond tipped drills.
  However, this comes at the price of speed and utilization of a strange 2x2x2 building system that does not fare well with other corporations.
  However, don't let this dissuade you from using their parts, as their heavy armor synergizes well with almost any corporation. 
  
  <p> <img style="width:500px;" src="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/terratech_gamepedia/f/fd/Venture.png?version=82dab5860ec1854c10d7ad672250f897" /> </p>
  
  <h3>Venture</h3>
  
  Venture is the scout and flight branch in Terratech. Their techs are optimized for speed and maximum maneuverability, and they have a wide range of flight parts which can be used to make extremely agile and balanced flyers.
  Their blocks are extremely lightweight but not sturdy, yet they have unique weaponry including the Venture Reaper X1 Flame Thrower. The style of their blocks is flashy and angular.
  Everything including the manufacturing blocks are tailored to being mobile, while having some compromises. The manufacturing and recourse processing branch of Venture is lacking in speed, but it can be on all the time. 
  
  <p> <img style="width:500px;" src="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/terratech_gamepedia/thumb/5/52/Hawkeye.png/200px-Hawkeye.png?version=160be4be50d4f0fd9645bfa9f9343a68" /> </p>
  
  <h3>Hawkeye</H3>
  
  Hawkeye is the high-end military corporation in TerraTech. It has the latest and greatest in weapons and tactical equipment such as tank treads, missiles, and miniguns.
  It has no resource processing equipment except for its own proprietary scrappers and fabricators. The mobility of this corporation is higher than GSO and lower than Venture, with bottom mounted wheels, bike wheels,
  and tank treads. Hawkeye has an extensive line of weapons and tactical defense equipment. Additionally, Hawkeye has flight blocks as well, including the first helicopter system in TerraTech.
  With this corporation, you can literally drop bombs on people. Also, Hawkeye has a lot of armor, and extremely stealthy location and radar systems.
